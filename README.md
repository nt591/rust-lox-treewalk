# rust-lox-treewalk
First half of Crafting Interpreters (jlox in rust)

# Inspiration
Now that I work on [Hack](docs.hhvm.com) I'd like to write my own typechecker from scratch for a tiny scripting language. There's plenty of source material to look at on Github, as well as academic papers. Should be fun!

# Goals
[] Finish the tree walk interpreter from the book
[] Add type annotations - create an ML-inspired syntax to declare that a variable must be of type x
[] Add type checking
[] Add const keywords?
